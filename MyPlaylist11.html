    <h1>So basically I shuffled through your playlists and sussed out a vibe. You like Latin beats, Smooth Jazz, Experimental, Electronic, Lofi R&B, Soft Vocals and Freestyle Rap (Amongst others).

I tried to pick Indian songs that fit that vibe (even If I don't like them). Key word is "tried". Surprisingly a lot of indian music isn't Lofi or Freestyle (crazy I know) but that's okay! I thnk you'll enjoy a lot of the sounds and beats and the instruments, and If you don't then that's okay :) (tweaking). 

Its roughly ordered based off of what I think you'll like from MOST to LEAST. Then starting at 31 to 40 is my top ten songs,  in no particular order. I don't think you'll enjoy them hahaha but it is what it is. 

P.S: I did this to spread my Indian nationalist agenda and counter-colonise the white man. Not because I love music and wanna share with you. 

P.P.S: If one day we get Into a conversation about immigration policy that does irreversible catastrophic damage to our bludship then I wlll press the self destruct button on this playlist.
